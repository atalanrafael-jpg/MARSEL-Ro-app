# MARSEL ROAPP — Canonical Project Data Structure

The repository already contains code, audit engines, documentation, MCP, plugins, tests, and operational material. The goal is to make the logical architecture explicit without destructive bulk moves.

## Root-file rule

New documentation must not be added to the repository root unless it is a canonical entrypoint (`README.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `VERSION`, or a narrowly justified technical entrypoint). New project-control documents belong under `00_PROJECT_CONTROL/` and domain documents under their domain directory.

## Data rule

Live ROAPP production data is not stored in Git. Git stores schemas, contracts, fixtures, audit metadata, and evidence manifests only. Credentials are never stored in Git.

## Migration rule

Existing files are not bulk-moved merely to make the tree look clean. A move is performed only when the target location is canonical, references are updated, tests pass, and the old location is proven obsolete.
